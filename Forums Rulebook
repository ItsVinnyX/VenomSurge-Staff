#This is the www.rektwarfare.com/forums rulebook.
In here, you'll see the basic guidelines when conducting your duties as staff on the forums.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Generally, accepting/denying reports of an accused player are left to Moderators+. Helpers generally do not need to manage the forums.

-When warning a player, warning points 1-3 act as verbally warning a user. They are to be as if you are just telling a player to stop double posting.
-Warning points 4-5 are like the /warn command. They are more formal.
-After 5 warning points, a player will be forum banned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#When banning a user, here is a few simple guidelines when determining the length.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Consistant double posting/necroposting after 5 points = 1-2 day ban.

If they persist, raise it to a week ban. If they still do not comply, ban them for two weeks.

If they still have not stopped, perm ban them. They are clearly not learning.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Accepting/Denying Reports of Accused Players
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a player is reported for hacking, chat offence, or other infractment, remember to be fair just as if you were in-game.

Make sure they do not crop any screenshot or video, as they may be hiding something they are doing wrong themselves.
If they do, do not accept their report.

When viewing over a report of a hacker, make sure you let an admin/owner review the report themselves before you accept it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Accepting/Rejecting a perm ban/mute appeal
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If someone does appeal to a perm ban/mute, first you must ask them for the evidence used to punish them.

They will most likely direct you to the staff member who punished them.

(Remember: This is the reason we ask that you gain sufficient evidence before issuing a punishment.)

Review the given evidence. If the staff who punished the player wishes to, they themself will attend to the appeal.

Whoever reviews the appeal will reconsider if the player was truly breaking the rules.

Remember that this must be VERY clear.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Locking/Deleting Threads
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Very rarely will you have to delete a thread.

Only delete a thread if it is purely made to discriminate another player, staff member, race, religion, server, etc. 

Only delete a thread if it advertises another server in any way as the main subject of the thread.

Locking threads will be a more common action.

Lock a thread only if it is:
-A resolved bug/glitch report
-A resolved ban appeal
-A resolved player report
-A resolved map submission
-It is an old thread that is just being post-boosted
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Whenever doing ANYTHING on the forums be sure to be professional and mature. You are representing any guests that may visit the server, so you want them to think highly of us.
