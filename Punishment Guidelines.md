# Punishment Guidelines

#REMEMBER. ALWAYS GAIN ACCURATE EVIDENCE BEFORE ISSUING A PUNISHMENT, WHETHER IT BE IN VIDEO OR PICTURE FORMAT. MAKE SURE YOUR EVIDENCE CLEARLY SHOWS THEM HACKING.

- Warn the player for hacking. If they do not turn them off, they will be punished.

# Chat Punishments

#- Swearing: If a player is swearing in chat please give them a warning

-To warn a player, do /warn <player> <reason>
-If a player is swearing after their warn, temporarily mute them for no more than 6 hours.
/tempmute <player> <time> <time form>
-(You do not have to include a reason in the command itself, but you must privately message them the reason they were muted.
-If player JoeBob119 is swearing after his warn, you would type:
-/tempban JoeBob119 3 h

-If they persist to swear, ban them for one day.
-/tempban <player> <time> <time form> <reason>

-You must only include an appeal link for very long bans (3 days and up)
- Wtf is exempt as this is not a offensive to you or anyone else.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#- Bypassing: Basically the same punishments for Swearing apply if they are bypassing the filter. Example: If cake was a filtered word -and you typed "c4ke" you would be warned/banned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#- Spamming: The minimum lines required to define spam is 3 lines in a small length of time. Small length of time varies, generally its about 30 seconds. Use common sense.

- Basically the same punishments for Swearing apply if they are spamming the filter. But the max mute time is four hours instead of six.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#-Advertising: If a player advertises in chat give them a six hour temp mute AFTER you warn them.
-/warn <player> <reason>
-/warn joebob119 Advertising
-/tempmute <player> <time> <time form> 
-/tempmute JoeBob119 6 h 
-If they continue to advertise, ban them perm.
-/ban <player> <reason>
-/ban joebob119 Consistant Advertising.

# Inpersonating Staff

-Impersonating staff is simply up to your discreation.
-You generally want to warn them before taking any serious action.
-/warn <player> <reason>
-/warn joebob119 Impersonation of Staff
-If they continue, mute them for 1-6 hours.
-/tempmute <player> <time> <time form> 
-/tempmute joebob119 3 h
-(Again, pm them the reason they were punished.)
