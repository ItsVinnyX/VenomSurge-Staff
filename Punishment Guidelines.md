# Chat Punishments

#- Swearing: If a player is swearing in chat please give them a warning.

- Please use this format when warning the player: /warn <player> Please stop swearing if you continue you will be muted.

- Please use this format when the player continues to swear: /gtempmute <player> <time (NO MORE THAN 6 HOURS)> You didn't stop swearing you are know temporary muted.

- If the player continues to swear after the mute simply ban them for 1 day with this format: /gtempban <player> 1d You have been banned for one day for swearing.

- Wtf is exempt as this is not a offensive to you or anyone else.

#- Bypassing: Basically the same punishments for Swearing apply if they are bypassing the filter. Example: If cake was a filtered word and you typed "c4ke" you would be warned/banned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#- Spamming: The minimum lines required to define spam is 3 lines in a small length of time. Small length of time varies, generally its about 30 seconds. Use common sense.

- Basically the same punishments for Swearing apply if they are spamming the filter. But the max mute time is four hours instead of six.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#-Advertising: If a player advertises in chat give them a six hour temp mute if they continue to advertise please give them a one day temp ban if they continue still then just ban them.

- Make sure to give them a warning on the first temp mute so you know they done it before if it ever happens again.
