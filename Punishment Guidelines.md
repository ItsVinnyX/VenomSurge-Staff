#- Bypassing: Basically the same punishments for Swearing apply if they are bypassing the filter. Example: If cake was a filtered word -and you typed "c4ke" you would be warned/banned.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#- Spamming: The minimum lines required to define spam is 3 lines in a small length of time. Small length of time varies, generally its about 30 seconds. Use common sense.

- Basically the same punishments for Swearing apply if they are spamming the filter. But the max mute time is four hours instead of six.

#-Advertising: If a player advertises in chat give them a six hour temp mute AFTER you warn them.

-/gtempmute JoeBob119 6 h

-If they continue, mute them for 1-6 hours.

-/gtempmute (player) (time) (time format)
