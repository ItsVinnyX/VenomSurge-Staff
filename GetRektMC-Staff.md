# GetRektMC-Staff

Staff Guidelines

A good thing to remember when doing your jobs is to make sure that GetRektMC is always a fun place to be. 
If someone accidentally double sends a message, there is no need to warn, or kick him for that. 

As a Helper, you are strictly on the lookout for Spammers/Advertisers.
You are NOT able to punish accused hackers.

As a Mod, you have the responsibility of a Helper, while also monitoring for any potential hackers. 
Because of our anti-cheat system, obvious hacking isn't possible. 
We only permit hacker bans when the evidence is clear and concise.

Our classification of different rules:

Spamming: 
- Repeated messages, for example sending the same message 5 times. 
- Pointless messages, for example as;lkdfjas;ldkjfa;dskjf;laksdj.
- Too many small messges, for example, “I” “Want” “To” “Win” “This” “Game”. Sent as six separate messages.
