# What we expect

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 1. Being active. We expect all staff members at VenomSurge to be active not only in-game we want you active on the site as well.
- 2. Being honest and not abusive with your power. At VenomSurge we do not tollerate rule breaking members of our team.
- 3. We expect staff to interact with Members and moderate!
- 4. We expect staff to be mature and know how to handle situations when they get out of hand.
- 5. We expect staff to be active in all chats such as Slack, Teamspeak, Skype, Discord, and finally the website.

# Failure to do so

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Not meeting our expectations is a huge deal here at VenomSurge, and it will result into an removal from the team.
